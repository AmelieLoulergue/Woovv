### WOOVV

---

Woovv is a platform to find the best workspaces all around you. Once you suscribed, you just need to specifiate the place you want to work and Woovv will display the closest coworking locations to the entered position. Then, you can directly book a place for the period you choosed.

## Useful

  <br>
- File app/db/scrapper.rb is a scrapper we developed to collect data from this [website](https://www.coworking-france.com/).

### R&D

We decided to do all of our commits in falafel‚Ä¢case, much more vegan, ecological, inclusive and performant for the planet than the kebab-case!
Be good with the Falafel, it will give it back to you &#129313; !
